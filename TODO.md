## 🎯 Priority Order

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
1. Increase test coverage to >90%
2. Create sample data for demonstration
3. Add dropdown values API endpoint

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
1. Start React frontend development
2. Implement core dashboard components
3. Add search and filtering to risk API

### Lower Priority (Week 5+)
1. Production deployment setup
2. Authentication system
3. Advanced analytics features

## 📝 Notes

- Focus on completing backend testing before starting frontend
- Sample data should demonstrate all dashboard metrics effectively
- Consider user feedback early in frontend development
- GCP deployment should be tested with staging environment first
- Security features (authentication) are essential before production use

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Risk update log creation needs better error handling
- [ ] Dashboard service queries could be optimized for performance
- [ ] File upload handling not yet implemented for future features
- [ ] CORS settings may need adjustment for production frontend
