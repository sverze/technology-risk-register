## 🎯 Priority Order

### High Priority (Current Focus)
1. ✅ Phase 2 Backend Features Complete - Test coverage >95%, Sample data, API enhancements
2. **Next: Start React frontend development**
3. Implement core dashboard components with real API integration

### Medium Priority
1. Complete dashboard implementation with charts and visualizations
2. Add comprehensive error handling and loading states
3. Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet

### Lower Priority
1. Production deployment setup
2. Authentication system
3. Advanced analytics features

## 📝 Notes

- Focus on completing backend testing before starting frontend
- Sample data should demonstrate all dashboard metrics effectively
- Consider user feedback early in frontend development
- GCP deployment should be tested with staging environment first
- Security features (authentication) are essential before production use

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Risk update log creation needs better error handling
- [ ] Dashboard service queries could be optimized for performance
- [ ] File upload handling not yet implemented for future features
- [ ] CORS settings may need adjustment for production frontend
