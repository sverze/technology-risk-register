## 📝 Notes

- Focus on completing backend testing before starting frontend
- Sample data should demonstrate all dashboard metrics effectively
- Consider user feedback early in frontend development
- GCP deployment should be tested with staging environment first
- Security features (authentication) are essential before production use

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] Risk update log creation needs better error handling
- [ ] Dashboard service queries could be optimized for performance
